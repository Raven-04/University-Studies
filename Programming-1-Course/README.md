Yay! My first course that concerns coding (great optimism as a Freshman :) ). Until, the reality had finally sunk in for me...

Keep in mind that this was basically the first time I have dealt with any form of serious coding/programming. So... the codes that are provided are not the best and most optimal. However, it is as they say, if it works, don't touch it.

So, yeah... Take it with a grain of salt.
