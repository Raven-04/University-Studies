Yay! My first course that concerns coding (great optimism as a Freshman :) ). Until, the reality had finally sunk in for me...

Keep in mind that this was basically the first time I have dealt with any form of serious coding/programming. So... the codes that are provided are not the best and most optimal. However, it is as they say, if it works, don't touch it.

So, yeah... Take it with a grain of salt.

This is what my university's professors and lab instructors have taught us at the American University of Sharjah (AUS).

All credit is given to them and their work that they have provided for their students.

I did not create all the codes on my own for all assignments, I mearly had to complete a portion of the code (like a function or something else) that were provided or fully write the entire code (typically the shorter codes were probably mine).

(I guess you can consider this as a reference...)
