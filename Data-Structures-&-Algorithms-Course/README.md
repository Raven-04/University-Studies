*Note: -*

When I took this course, I honestly had way more fun as compared to Prog. 1 & 2. Don't know why though, it might have been the instructor, class, or the material that kept me engaged in the course.

Also, my coding style oddly changed as well. I started to focus on the code's optamility rather than it's organization.

Anyways, I felt like I made great progress concerning coding in general.
